\section{Planning Ground}
Let's figure out what the plan is here:

\begin{description}
    \item[Flat Metrics] 
        Write it up.
        We did some writing for triplet based metrics, let's do the same for flat metrics.
    \item[Implementation] 
        Let's implement what's written in the test suites.
        We need to test their results and run speed.
