# Agent Instructions

Concise guidance for AI agents working with this music information retrieval codebase.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First:** Keep code elegant, concise, and maintainable. Avoid over-engineering. Cleanliness is godliness.
- **Core Classes:** Built around `TimeSeries`, `Segmentation`, and `Hierarchy` - use extensively and keep robust
- **Thoughtful API Design:** Design the API for the core classes to be intuitive and easy to use; consider the user's perspective; this is tooling for researchers, not for developers;
- **Research Focus:** Support music structure analysis and representation research questions
- **80/20 Rule:** Achieve maximum impact with minimal effort

## Development Guidelines

- **Testing:** Maintain tests pragmatically without slowing development; make tests failure driven; test apps/ folder too and add tests from app failures;
- **Documentation:** Clear docstrings for complex logic and public APIs; Sphinx + RTD ready; build and consult the docs actively during development, planning, and ideation
- **Dependencies:** Prefer pixi; minimal external dependencies; keep tomls current and use pixi tasks.
    - **Pixi Tasks:** Use `pixi run check` for a full validation pipeline (format, lint, types, test). Other tasks like `pixi run format`, `pixi run lint`, `pixi run test`, `pixi run docs-build` are also available. Consult `pixi.toml` for details; keep toml files current and run `pixi install` when toml changes.
- **Code Style:** Meaningful naming, logical structure, selective type hints. Adhere to ruff formatting.
- **Data Format:** Prefer feather files; prioritize native core classes over jams/json/mir_eval formats but support them.


## Agent Notes

*(Add development insights, common patterns, useful commands, etc.)*

### User is working on...
- Streamlining and stabilizing the core data classes and API.
- building the app in streamlit to interactive ask research questions about the data.
