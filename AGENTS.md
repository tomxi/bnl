# Agent Instructions

Concise guidance for AI agents working with this music information retrieval codebase.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First:** Keep code elegant, concise, and maintainable. Avoid over-engineering. Cleanliness is godliness.
- **Core Classes:** Built around `TimeSeries`, `Segmentation`, and `Hierarchy` - use extensively and keep robust
- **Research Focus:** Support music structure analysis and representation research questions
- **80/20 Rule:** Achieve maximum impact with minimal effort

## Development Guidelines

- **Testing:** Maintain tests pragmatically without slowing development; test apps/ folder too
- **Documentation:** Clear docstrings for complex logic and public APIs; Sphinx + RTD ready
- **Dependencies:** Prefer pixi; minimal external dependencies
- **Code Style:** Meaningful naming, logical structure, selective type hints
- **Data Format:** Prefer feather files; prioritize native core classes over jams/json/mir_eval formats but support them
